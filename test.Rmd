## Christen Parzych Assignment 1 


``` {r}
## 1. A sentence that says, "Hello, World!"
print("Hello, World!")
```

```{r load_data}
## 2. R output that summarizes the variables in the college.Rdata dataset

load("college.Rdata")

summary(sc)
```

```{r}
##Calculate the average earnings for individuals at the most selective colleges, then compare that with individuals at the least selective colleges in the dataset.

library(tidyverse)
sc%>%filter(adm_rate<.1)%>%summarize(mean_earnings=mean(md_earn_wne_p6,na.rm=TRUE))

sc%>%filter(adm_rate>.3)%>%summarize(mean_earnings=mean(md_earn_wne_p6,na.rm=TRUE))

##Average earnings for individuals at the most selective colleges is $53,500, while the average earning sfor individuals at the least selective colleges is $34,747.14. I am testing this change.
